# Release Notes - Version 2.6.3.1

**Release Date:** September 2, 2025
**Version:** 2.6.3.1 - CRITICAL ADMIN FIX: Fixed Closing Costs Validation
**Previous Version:** 2.6.3

## üö® Critical Fix Overview

Version 2.6.3.1 resolves a **critical admin interface bug** that was preventing loan officers from updating fixed closing costs through the admin panel.

## ‚ùå The Problem

The admin validation system was overly restrictive and only allowed two calculation bases:
- `purchase_price`
- `loan_amount`

However, the actual configuration uses `fixed` for many closing costs like:
- Appraisal fees ($675)
- Credit report fees ($249)
- Processing fees ($650)
- Doc prep fees ($240)
- Attorney fees ($1,200)
- Recording fees ($60)
- And more...

This caused validation errors when trying to update these fixed costs, with the message: *"Calculation base must be one of: purchase_price, loan_amount"*

## ‚úÖ The Solution

**Fixed File:** `admin_logic.py` line 90

**Before:**
```python
valid_bases = ["purchase_price", "loan_amount"]
```

**After:**
```python
valid_bases = ["purchase_price", "loan_amount", "fixed"]
```

- ‚úÖ Processing fee: $575 ‚Üí $650
