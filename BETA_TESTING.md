## What to Test

Please focus on testing the following key features:

1. **Basic Calculation Accuracy**
   - Test various loan amounts, down payments, and interest rates
   - Verify that monthly payments, loan details, and closing costs make sense
   - Compare results with other calculators if possible

2. **Special Loan Types**
   - Test calculations for different loan types (Conventional, FHA, VA, USDA)
   - Pay special attention to VA loans and seller contribution limits
   - Verify that discount points are properly displayed and calculated

3. **User Interface**
   - Test on different devices and screen sizes
   - Check that all results are clearly displayed and easy to understand
   - Verify that the form is easy to use and provides appropriate feedback

4. **Edge Cases**
   - Try extreme values (very high/low purchase prices, interest rates, etc.)
   - Test with zero values for optional fields
   - Look for any unexpected behavior or errors
