# Release Notes - Version 2.6.0

**Release Date:** January 6, 2025
**Version:** 2.6.0 - Enhanced LTV Accuracy & Refinance Improvements

## Overview

Version 2.6.0 focuses on fixing critical calculation accuracy issues in the LTV targets table and enhancing the refinance calculation experience. This release addresses several user-reported issues where LTV target calculations were showing incorrect appraised values.

## üîß Critical Fixes

### LTV Target Calculation Accuracy
- **Problem**: Frontend JavaScript was overriding accurate backend calculations, showing ~$370,000 instead of the correct ~$404,000-$411,000 for required appraised values
- **Solution**: Completely refactored LTV calculations to use backend-computed values exclusively
- **Impact**: Users now see accurate appraised value requirements for their refinance scenarios

### Cash-Out Refinance Logic
- **Fixed**: Cash-out refinance calculations now properly show cash received rather than cash needed
- **Fixed**: Runtime errors with uninitialized variables in refinance scenarios
- **Enhanced**: Better handling of closing costs and prepaids in cash-out scenarios

## üÜï New Features

### Dynamic Maximum LTV Calculations
The system now automatically calculates and displays maximum LTV targets based on your specific loan type and refinance type:

- **Conventional Rate/Term**: 97% LTV target
- **FHA Rate/Term**: 96.5% LTV target
- **VA Rate/Term**: 100% LTV target
- **Cash-Out Refinances**: Appropriate maximum LTV limits (typically 80%)

### HOA Fee Integration
- **New Input Field**: Added HOA (Homeowner's Association) fee input to refinance form
- **Full Integration**: HOA fees are now properly integrated into all refinance calculations
- **Monthly Payment Display**: HOA fees appear correctly in monthly payment breakdowns

### Enhanced Break-Even Analysis
- **Clarification**: Break-even calculations now clearly use only Principal & Interest + Extra Monthly Savings
- **Accuracy**: HOA, taxes, and insurance are excluded from break-even analysis since they don't change with refinancing

## üé® User Interface Improvements

### Cleaner LTV Targets Display
- **Title**: "Required Appraised Values for LTV Targets" ‚Üí "Appraised Values for LTV Targets"
- **Column Header**: "Required Appraised Value" ‚Üí "Appraised Value"
- **Formatting**: All appraised values now round up to the nearest thousand for cleaner display

### Enhanced Visual Presentation
- **Removed Clutter**: Eliminated unnecessary "Required" terminology throughout the interface
- **Improved Clarity**: Better labeling and description of LTV target calculations
- **Consistent Formatting**: Standardized currency formatting across all LTV displays

## üîß Technical Improvements

### Backend Enhancements
- **Centralized Calculations**: All LTV target calculations now performed in the backend for consistency
- **Dynamic LTV Logic**: System automatically includes appropriate maximum LTV based on loan parameters
- **Enhanced Response Data**: Added `loan_type` to API responses for proper frontend processing
- **Improved Rounding**: Implemented proper ceiling function for rounding up to nearest thousand

### Frontend Architecture
- **New Renderer Method**: Added `updateLtvTargetsTable()` method to refinance result renderer
- **Backend Integration**: Frontend now consumes backend-calculated values instead of performing its own calculations
- **Eliminated Conflicts**: Removed frontend JavaScript that was overriding correct backend values

### Form Data Management
- **Enhanced Collection**: Improved HOA fee integration throughout the calculation pipeline
- **Better Validation**: Enhanced form data validation for refinance scenarios
- **Consistent Processing**: Standardized form data handling across all refinance types

## üìä Calculation Examples

### Before vs. After Accuracy
| Scenario | Before (v2.5.5) | After (v2.6.0) | Improvement |
|----------|------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| 80% LTV Target | ~$370,000 | ~$411,000 | +$41,000 accuracy |
| 90% LTV Target | Inconsistent | ~$365,000 | Accurate calculation |
| 97% LTV (Conv.) | Not shown | ~$306,000 | New feature |

### Maximum LTV Examples
- **Conventional Rate/Term Refinance**: Now shows 97% LTV target at ~$306,000
- **FHA Rate/Term Refinance**: Now shows 96.5% LTV target at ~$308,000
- **VA Rate/Term Refinance**: Now shows 100% LTV target when applicable

## üöÄ Deployment Notes

### Zero Downtime Update
- **No Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality preserved
- **Backward Compatible**: Previous refinance calculations continue to work
- **No Database Changes**: No schema modifications required

### Testing Checklist
- [x] Verify LTV targets show correct appraised values (~$404K-$411K range)
- [x] Test maximum LTV calculations for different loan types
- [x] Confirm HOA fee integration works properly
- [x] Validate cash-out refinance logic improvements
- [x] Check UI label updates display correctly

## üîç Migration Impact

### For Users
- **Immediate**: More accurate LTV target calculations
- **Enhanced**: Better understanding of maximum LTV options
- **Simplified**: Cleaner interface with improved labeling

### For Developers
- **Architecture**: LTV calculations now centralized in backend
- **Maintenance**: Reduced complexity by eliminating duplicate calculation logic
- **Extensibility**: Easier to add new LTV targets or modify existing ones

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Resolved Issues
1. **LTV Target Inaccuracy**: Fixed ~$40,000 discrepancy in required appraised values
2. **Cash-Out Display**: Fixed cash-out refinances incorrectly showing cash needed instead of cash received
3. **Runtime Errors**: Fixed variable initialization issues in refinance calculations
4. **Missing Maximum LTV**: Added display of loan-type-specific maximum LTV targets
5. **UI Inconsistencies**: Standardized terminology and formatting throughout LTV displays

### Performance Improvements
- **Faster Calculations**: Eliminated redundant frontend calculations
- **Better Caching**: Backend calculations cached for consistent results
- **Reduced Complexity**: Simplified frontend logic reduces potential for errors

## üìà Future Considerations

### Planned Enhancements
- Enhanced mobile responsiveness for LTV tables
- Integration with real-time appraisal data APIs
- Additional loan type support for specialized scenarios

### Feedback Integration
This release directly addresses user feedback regarding LTV calculation accuracy and interface clarity. We continue to monitor user interactions to identify areas for further improvement.
