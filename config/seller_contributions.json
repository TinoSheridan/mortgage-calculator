    "Conventional loans follow Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guidelines, with limits varying based on down payment/LTV ratio and property use.",
    "FHA loans permit seller contributions up to 6% for closing costs, discount points, and other financing concessions. Any amount exceeding 6% is considered a reduction in the purchase price.",
    "VA loans allow sellers to pay all closing costs but limit concessions (items like prepaid expenses and discount points) to 4% of the purchase price.",
    "USDA loans follow a 6% limit similar to FHA loans for closing costs, prepaid expenses, and discount points.",
    "Seller contributions (also called seller concessions) typically include closing costs normally paid by the buyer, prepaid items, discount points, interest rate buydowns, HOA dues, and non-realty items.",
    "The base for calculating the maximum is always the lesser of the purchase price or appraised value.",
    "These limits are subject to change based on lender overlays and periodic updates to government lending programs."
