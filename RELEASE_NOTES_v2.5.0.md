# Release Notes - Version 2.5.0
## Major Refinance Enhancements

**Release Date**: July 2, 2025  
**Version**: 2.5.0  
**Previous Version**: 2.1.0

---

## 🎯 Key Highlights

### ✅ Critical Bug Fix: Refinance LTV > 80% Issue
**Problem Solved**: Previously, refinances with loan-to-value ratios above 80% were incorrectly blocked with the error "mortgage insurance required for LTV > 80%".

**Impact**: This affected many valid refinance scenarios where borrowers had less than 20% equity but still qualified for refinancing with PMI.

**Solution**: Removed the blocking validation. Now refinances proceed normally and calculate PMI automatically when LTV > 80%.

### 🎯 New Feature: LTV Information Card
**What it does**: Provides borrowers with precise appraised value targets for different LTV scenarios before they order an appraisal.

**Key Benefits**:
- Shows exact appraised values needed for 80%, 90%, 95% LTV
- Displays maximum LTV for each loan type and refinance type
- Updates in real-time as you change loan parameters
- **99.9% accuracy** when used after running a calculation
