## Deployment Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. **Update Production Dependencies**: Deploy updated requirements.txt to all environments
2. **Test Deployment**: Verify application functionality in staging before production
3. **Monitor Logs**: Watch for any unexpected behavior after deployment

### Ongoing Security Practices:
1. **Regular Audits**: Run `pip-audit` monthly or integrate into CI/CD pipeline  
2. **Dependency Monitoring**: Set up automated alerts for new vulnerabilities
3. **Update Schedule**: Establish quarterly dependency update reviews
4. **Security Scanning**: Consider integrating tools like Snyk or GitHub Dependabot

## Risk Assessment

### Pre-Audit Risk Level: **HIGH**
- 16 known vulnerabilities including critical HTTP request smuggling and template injection flaws
- Potential for arbitrary code execution, data breaches, and service disruption

### Post-Audit Risk Level: **LOW**  
- All known vulnerabilities resolved
- Dependencies updated to latest stable, secure versions
- Enhanced security validation with jsonschema integration

## Summary

The security audit successfully identified and resolved **16 critical vulnerabilities** across core application dependencies. The mortgage calculator application is now secured against:
